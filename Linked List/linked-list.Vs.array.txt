#### Linked List .Vs. Array

### Linked List
	1. Linked list nodes are allocated, whenever there is need to add a new node, which is storage efficient, compared to allocating bunch of bytes in (arrays).
	2. In linked list nodes are allocated non-contiguous from the heap unlike array.

### Problem with Arrays

	1. Static Arrays are of fixed size and Dynamic Arrays can be grow, but if reallocation fails it leads to data loss.

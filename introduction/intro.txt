###(What are data structures)

A program is a set of instructions which performs operations on data.without data instructions cannot be performed.So data is a important part of 
the program. So when the program is dealing with the data, how it will organize the data in the main memory.That is what data structures.The way 
you organize the data in the main memory during execution time of a program.

###(List of data structures and algorithm techniques)

    1.Arrays
    2.Matrices
    3.Linked List
    4.Stack
    5.Queues
    6.Trees
    7.Graph
    8.Hashing
    9.Recursion
    10.Sortings


    ##(Physical data structures)

    These are the data structures they defines how data is arranged in memory.

        1.Arrays
        2.Matrices
        3.Linked List

    ##(Logical data structures)

    These are the data structures that defines how the data can be utilized,how the arrangement is and how it should be utilized.

        1.Stack
        2.Queues
        3.Trees
        4.Graph
        5.Hashing
